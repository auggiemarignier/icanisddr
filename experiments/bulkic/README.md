# Bulk IC Synthetic Example

As a first example, we consider an inner core that can be represented as a single crystal i.e. one elastic tensor.
This elastic tensor will be cylindrically anisotropic with fast axis parallel to the rotation axis, which is the "middle" member between a completely arbitrarily rotated elastic tensor and a fully isotropic tensor.

We consider the impossible case where we have near-perfect ray coverage with sources and receivers equally spaced all over the surface of the IC.
