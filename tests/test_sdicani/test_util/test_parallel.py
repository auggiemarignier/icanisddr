"""Tests for DummyPool ensuring behavioural parity with multiprocessing.Pool subset.

All tests compare DummyPool against multiprocessing.Pool for the supported
methods: map, starmap, imap plus context manager behaviour. The goal is to
verify order, return types and exception propagation so calling code can
switch between serial and parallel execution without branching.
